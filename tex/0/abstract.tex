\begin{abstracts} 

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions of magnetized plasma from the low solar atmosphere into interplanetary space. With energies of up to $10^{26}$\,J, they are the most energetic eruptive phenomena in the solar system and are also the driver of radio-bright plasma shocks from the corona into the heliosphere. However, the nature of the forces governing their eruption, and how this eruption drives a radio bright shock, is poorly understood.
