A huge thank you to Peter Gallagher. Your guidance, advice and support have never steered me wrong, and your enthusiasm for this subject has been a huge source of inspiration. It has been a pleasure working with you over the last four years. 

Secondly, I would like to thank James McAteer for his help at the beginning of my research and getting me off to a great start. To Shaun Bloomfield and David P\'{e}rez-Su\'{a}rez, thank you for all your useful discussions and help from the beginning.

Thank you to Pietro Zucca and Joe McCauley. Those dedicated days in rainy Birr got us a long way.

Most importantly, Peadar, Bridget and Lisa. I couldn't have done this without your love and support. I'd be nowhere without you. To Mags and all my friends, thank you all for such good times throughout the years.

Of course, to all the people of the Astrophysics Research Group, past and present. Thank you for all the laughs and being friends from the start. And finally, shout out to Pythagoras, changed the game.
