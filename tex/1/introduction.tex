\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:1}

The Sun has long been the focus of humanity's curiosity. Throughout history it has been the harbinger of new religions, philosophies, and sciences. It has changed our understanding of our place in the Universe and allowed us to push forward the frontiers of stellar astronomy. Although our understanding of the Sun is nowadays more advanced, the curiosity we hold for it has not changed since the very early humans.
Now, we understand the Sun is a star similar to any other in its class, currently going through a relatively unchanging 11 year cycle of activity that is extremely rich in physical complexity. The study of such complex phenomena has yielded immeasurable advances in many areas of physics such as spectroscopy, plasma physics, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), particle physics, to name but a few. Although some of these sciences have grown over decades (or even centuries) they are still incomplete. I hope this theses, in some small way, will contribute to the continuing growth of these sciences and to the understanding of our nearest star.


%Here is the introduction of the thesis, complete with a few references  \citep{sagan1997demon, prothero2007evolution}.  Section \ref{sec:1} contains Equation \ref{eqn:1}, Section \ref{sec:2} has Figure \ref{fig:1} and Section \ref{sec:3} has Table \ref{tab:1}. Chapter \ref{chap:2} has pretty much nothing in it.

\section{The Sun}\label{sec:1}

The Sun is our nearest star, located $1.49\times10^6$\,km from Earth at the centre of our solar system. Located on the main sequence of the Hetzpring-Russel (HR) diagram, it has a spectral class of G2V, with a luminosity of $L_{\odot}=(3.84\pm 0.04)\times10^{26}$\,W, mass of $M_{\odot}=(1.989\pm0.0003)\times10^{30}$\,kg and radius of $R_{\odot}=(6.959\pm0.007)\times10^8$\,m \citep{foukal2004}. It was born approximately $4.6 \times 10^9$\,years ago when a giant molecular cloud underwent gravitational collapse and began hydrogen nuclear fusion at its centre (reference). The energy produced from this fusion resulted in enough pressure to counteract gravitational contraction and bring about a hydrostatic equilibrium, allowing the young star to reach a stability that is sustained today. It is estimated the Sun will maintain this stability for another 5 billion years, at which point, it will move off the main sequence and into a red giant phase. During this later part of its life, it will grow in size to 100 times its current radius and begin nuclear burning of heavier elements such as carbon and oxygen. Once carbon burning in the core has ceased it can no longer sustain nuclear fusion of heavier elements, resulting in a gravitational instability that will eventually lead to a stellar nova. This nova will result in the loss of the outer envelopes and ultimately the Sun's death, leaving behind a compact and dense white-dwarf.

Until such time, the Sun will remain on the main sequence in a regular state of hydrogen fusion in its core. The energy released during this process is the ultimate source of light and all energetic activity that we observe from Earth and beyond. Before we can understand how this energy manifests in the solar atmosphere as a variety of energetic phenomena, it is important to understand how the energy is generated and transported through its interior and finally released into its atmosphere and interplanetary space.

\subsection{Solar Interior}\label{sec:10}

The theoretical development on how the solar interior is structured and how it behaves has been through what is known as the \textquoteleft standard solar model' or SSM. The SSM is a grouping of theories that described how the Sun was formed, how it maintains its stability, how it generates energy, and how this energy is transported through its interior and released at the surface. Much of the major developments of this theory have been in the 20th century, due mainly to the pioneering experiments in solar neutrino physics and helioseismsology. Hence, the development of the SSM has mainly been through a refinement of the theory based on these observational fields. Although the SSM has increased in sophistication, its four main aspects remain the most general framework for describing the behavior of the solar interior.

The SSM firstly states that the Sun was born from the gravitational collapse of a primordial gas of hydrogen, helium, and traces of other heavy elements. Secondly, it maintains its structural stability via a hydrostatic equilibrium such that the gravitational force is balanced by a pressure gradient ($\grad{P}=-\rho g$) at each radial distance inside the star. The third main aspect of the SSM involves the source of the Sun's energy. Much of the early ideas proposed during the 19th century involved some form of chemical reaction or energy released during a slow gravitational contraction. However, during the first half of the 20th century the theory that the Sun is at least as old as the Earth began to come into focus. The idea of the Sun being more than 4.5 billion years old prompted the question of what energy source could sustain the Sun's luminosity for such a length of time. It was soon realised that thermonuclear fusion must be the source of such energy, and, as a result, it should be possible to observe the neutrino products of this fusion. Hence, starting in the 1950s a number of pioneering neutrino physics experiments were developed in an attempt to detect solar-generated neutrinos at Earth. These pioneering experiments, as well as there more sophisticated counterparts today, confirm much of the theories on solar core energy generation.

From the 1950s onwards there has been a confirmed detection of neutrinos generated in a hydrogen fusion process, namely the proton-proton or \textquoteleft pp'-chain, in the solar core. In this process, four protons are fused to form a helium nucleus. This can occur in a variety of ways, but at the Sun's core temperature of 15 MK, the dominant reaction is the pp 1 chain given by
\begin{equation}
^{1}_1\mathrm{H} + ^{1}_1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ~^{2}_1\mathrm{H} + e^{+}  + \nu_e
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
^{2}_1\mathrm{H} + ^{1}_1\mathrm{H} \rightarrow ~^{3}_2\mathrm{He} + \gamma
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
^{3}_2\mathrm{He}+^{3}_2\mathrm{He} \rightarrow ~^{4}_2\mathrm{He} + 2^{1}_1\mathrm{H}
\end{equation}
where $^{1}_1\mathrm{H}$ is a hydrogen nucelus, $^{2}_1\mathrm{H}$ is deuterium, $^{3}_2\mathrm{He}$ is tritium, $^{4}_2\mathrm{He}$ is helium, $e^{+}$ is a positron, $\nu_e$ is an electron neutrino, and $\gamma$ is a gamma ray photon. Reactions (1.1) and (1.2) must happen twice for (1.3) to occur. Taking this into account, the entire process may be summarised as 
\begin{equation}
4 ^{1}_1\mathrm{H}  \rightarrow ~^{4}_2\mathrm{He} + 2e^{+} + 2\nu_e + 2\gamma
\end{equation}
liberating $4.2\times10^{-12}$J of energy, with $\sim2.4$\% of the energy carried away by the neutrinos. This particular form of the pp-chain (pp 1) occurs in 86\% of the cases \citep{turk2011}. However, there are other reactions capable of producing He from H catagorized into pp II, pp III etc, which each involve production of $^7_4$Be and $^8_5$B. The initial neutrino detections at Earth were the result of the pp III reaction which involves the creation of $^8_5$B, followed by a decay to $^8_4$Be, a positron, and an electron neutrino \citep{davis1968}. These early detections and the results of more recent experiments such as the SuperKamiokande \citep{fukuda1998} show that the expected neutrino flux given by the standard solar model is smaller than the observed. This deficit in in neutrino flux observations became the famed \textquoteleft solar neutrino problem' during the 1970s. 
One of the proposed explanations for the process was via an oscillation of the neutrino amongst three sets of 'flavors' i.e., the neutrino can be either an electron $\nu_e$, muon $\nu_{\mu}$, or tau $\nu_{\tau}$ neutrino. With the original detectors only being able to detect the $\nu_e$, this would result in a flux deficit (non-detection of $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$). This oscillation amongst three flavors was given the name the \textquoteleft MSW effect' after \citet{mikheev1986} and \citet{wolfenstein1978}, and later confirmed experimentally by the SuperKamionkande experiment.

The neutrino experiments together with the standard solar model SSM provide much of what we know about the solar energy generation and the solar core. They imply a temperature of $15.6\times10^6$K and density of $1.48\times10^5$\,kg\,m$^{-3}$ at solar centre, and also confirm the existence of a variety of pp reactions (pp 1 to pp IV), and some level of Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) fusion process. These fusion processes occur over $0.0-0.25\,R_{\odot}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:solar_atmosphere}), which defines the solar core. Outside the core the temperature drops to a value such that fusion ceases. While thermonuclear fusion is the third aspect of the SSM involves the generation of solar energy, the fourth aspect involves exactly what happens to this energy once it is generated i.e., it describes an energy transport mechanism.


Beyond $0.25\,R_{\odot}$ the temperature drops to 8 MK, such that fusion stops but only free protons and electrons exist. In this environment, the photons continuously scatter off free particles, undergoing a random walk toward the surface over a distance of $0.25-0.7\,R_{\odot}$. This region is known as the radiative zone and has densities of $2\times10^4-2\times10^2$\,kg\,m$^{-3}$, resulting in a small photon mean free path (mfp) of $9.0\times10^{-4}$\,m. The photons proceed towards the solar surface over a very long time scale, taking on the order of $10^{5}$ years to traverse this region \citep{mitalas1992}. If radiative energy transport occurs, it will result in the following temperature gradient
\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dr} = -\frac{3}{16 \sigma}\frac{\kappa \rho}{T^3}F_{rad}
\end{equation}

%Note the above equation is actually a diffusion equation for radiation. Take the divergence of both sides and you have $\grad\dotF = \kappa^'\grad^2 T$, with $\kappa^'$ being the diffusion coefficient given by $\kappa^i=\frac{16\pi\sigmaT^3}{3\kappa \rho}$ e.g., the opacity controls to mean free path, and hence the diffusion of photons.


where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzman constant, $\kappa$ is the mass extinction coefficient (opacity per unit mass), $\rho$ is mass density, $T$ is temperature, and $F_{rad}$ is the outward radiative flux. This implies that for a particular outward flux, if the opacity increases, a steeper temperature gradient is required to maintain such a flux. At $0.7\,R_{\odot}$ the temperature drops to 1\,MK allowing protons to capture electrons into a bound orbit. The existence of electrons in atomic orbit results in a dramatic increase in opacity of the plasma \citep{turk2011} and hence the temperature gradient increases. The increased temperature gradient required to sustain the energy flow may lead to the onset of a convective instability beyond $0.7\,R_{\odot}$ toward the solar surface. This instability will occur if the temperature gradient in the star is steeper than the adiabatic temperature gradient
\begin{equation}
\Bigg|\frac{dT}{dr}\Bigg|_{star} > \Bigg|\frac{dT}{dr}\Bigg|_{adiabatic}
\end{equation}
This is known as the Schwarzchild criterion, and it is fulfilled from $0.7-1\,R_{\odot}$ $-$a region known as the convection zone. The temperature and density drop as height increases and finally reaches T$\sim$$6000$\,K and mass densities of $\rho\sim1\times10^{-5}$\,kg\,m$^{-3}$. Although no complete theoretical treatment of convection exists, mixing length theory and hydrodynamical modeling are used to determine how convection occurs in the solar interior. Convection ceases at $1\,R_{\odot}$, where the environment makes a sudden transition to convectively stability. At this point the opacity drops and energy is released in the form of radiation, demarcating the start of the solar surface, known as the photosphere.

% Yuhong Fan, Living Reviews. "Because of the rapid decrease of the various scale heights in the top layer of the solar convection zone which demands increasing numerical resolution, it is not yet feasible to perform 3D MHD simulations that extend from the bottom of the convection zone all the way to the photosphere."

Much of what we know about the depth, temperature, and density of the convection zones come from a fine-tuning of the standard solar model, such that the model reproduces observations from neutrino and helioseismology experiments. In fact helioseismology alone can indicate great detail of the internal structure of the Sun. This field makes use of the fact the Sun acts as a resonator for acoustic waves which manifest as detectable oscillations in the doppler shift of photospheric Fraunhofer lines. These acoustic waves are referred to as pressure or p-modes, and a variety of wavelengths exist. Wavelengths that are an integer multiple of of the solar cavity may exist as standing wave modes. Such wave modes have a period of approximately 5 minutes \citep{turk2011}. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0.5cm 0cm 0cm, width=1.0\textwidth]{images/differential_rot.png}
\caption{Helioseismological determination of interior rotation rate in nanoHertz (nHz) as a function solar radius, starting from solar centre ($r=0.0$) to surface ($r=1.0$). The separate symbols show different latitudes, from $0^{\circ}$ to $75^{\circ}$. The data show that the interior rotates differentially down to $\sim$$0.7\,R_{\odot}$. The dashed line demarcates the boundary between solid body rotation and differential rotation \citep{thompson2003}.}
\label{fig:diff_rot} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The shorter wavelengths in the mode propagate into the solar convection zone and experience a total internal reflection at a shallow depth, while longer wavelengths can penetrate into much deeper layers. Hence depending on the period observed, the oscillations provide a probe of the internal thermodynamic properties at a particular level. Once such property closely monitored is the sound speed, which is seen to match the predicted sound speed based on the standard model. However, the observation and prediction show the biggest deviation at a depth of $0.3\,R_{\odot}$, which is the region where the radiative zone transitions to the convective zone. This obviously implies that SSM is lacking in its description of how the solar interior is stratified at this depth. This partly due to the fact the SSM does not take into account differential rotation. The solar surface rotates faster at the equator than it does at the poles i.e., angular velocity is stratified with latitude. Helioseismology has revealed that such differential rotational continues to the bottom of the convection zone. In the deeper radiative zone and core the Sun rotates as a solid body see Figure~\ref{fig:diff_rot}. There is a dramatic change in the internal dynamics when transitioning from convective to radiative zones. 

As predicted by sound speed measurements and differential rotation, the region sandwiched in between radiative and convective zones is and extremely important boundary. It is known as the tachocline, and the dynamics of this thin layer is believed to play and extremely important role in the generation and evolution of the solar magnetic field \citep{thompson2003}.




\subsection{Solar Magnetic Field and Dynamo}\label{sec:11}

The solar magnetic field is the ultimately source of all energetic activity in the its atmosphere. At solar activity minimum the solar magnetic field has a poloidal dipolar structure, with the polar axes generally being coincident with the rotational axes. However as the the activity cycle progresses towards a maximum, the field gains a strong toroidal component, making it far more dynamic and complex. This complex toroidal component manifests at the surface as sunspots, hence the number of sunspots on disk has been used as a proxy for the activity cycle for over 100 years, often showing an approximate 11 year periodicity (Figure~\ref{fig:butterfly}, bottom panel). At the beginning of the cycle sunspots tend to appear on disk with a latitudinal distribution of $\pm30^{\circ}$ of the equator. As the cycle progresses, sunspots appear at lower and lower latitude (known as Sp\"{o}rer's law), until they eventually disappear at the end of a cycle. Sunspot latitude with respect to time is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:butterfly}, top panel, and is known as the butterfly diagram.

Sunspots in there simplest case emerge as a dipole structure, with the leading spot being closer to the equator, such that the dipole is titled relative to the solar equator (Joy's law). In a given hemisphere, the leading sunspot and trailing spot have opposite polarities, with the polarities reversed in the other hemisphere  (Hayle's law). The trailing polarity can often be more fragmented and dispersed that the leading polarity. Despite sunspots generally having a dipolar structure, spot groups can be far more complex, having a multipolar structure (this will be described more later).

Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun changes polarity (at the time of sunspot maximum). For example, an overall dipolar configuration of North-South will become South-North, another cycle will bring it back to N-S once more. While the activity cycle usually last 11 years, one full magnetic cycle has a period of 22 years.

\caption{Differential rotation and flux freezing result in the poloidal dipolar magnetic field, generated by dynamo action, to be dragged around in a toroidal direction, an action known as the omega effect.

\label{fig:Babcock} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The complex behavior of the solar magnetic field over an 11 year activity cycle, during which the dipole flips, is generally explained by solar dynamo theory. This involves large-scale flow patterns of the solar interior that act to both induct and diffuse the magnetic field such that it produces the familiar 11 year magnetic activity cycle. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is employed such that the magnetic induction equation and velocity field equation (equation of motion) are solved in numerical models to produce a toroidal field from a poloidal one, a process known as the $\Omega$-effect. The theories must adhere to the constraints provided by observations of the sunspot cycle (Sp\"{o}rer's, Joy's, and Hale's laws), and also helioseismology observations of how the interior is structured.


\citet{babcock1961} first proposed a mechanism whereby the differential rotation of the solar convection zone tends to drag the field from a poloidal position into a toroidal one, eventually winding the field into a a stressed state, see Figure~\ref{fig:Babcock}. The main storage of this wound field is in the region below the convection zone known as the tachocline. This region is known as an 'overshoot' layer, in which descending convective flows are a trapped due the subadiabicity of the region (convectively stable). This stability allows field to be built up and stored into complex magnetic structures. Parts of this structure may form a twisted magnetic 'flux-rope', and due to it's excess magnetic pressure, it becomes convectively unstable and begins to rise. During this rise a Coriolis force has a tendency to tilt into a north-south orientation and eventually penetrate through the solar surface and into the atmosphere, known as the $\alpha$-effect (the tilt from Coriolis effects explains Joy's law). Dynamo theory attempts to explain the $\Omega$-effect wrapping and build up of toroidal flux in the solar interior via inductive plasma flows \citep{charbon2010}, particularly using the observed flow structure from helioseismology. Further MHD of convective instabilities is employed to describe the $\alpha$-effect rise of flux systems into the solar atmosphere from the stably convective tachcoline/overshoot layer. This is very much a study in itself, and describes the eventual formation coronal active regions from sub-photospheric flux-systems \citep{fan2009}. 


\subsection{Solar Atmosphere}\label{sec:12}

The solar atmosphere begins above the visible surface of the sun, known as the photosphere. At this point, the Sun become optically thin to visible radiation and light escapes from this surface. Beyond this visible surface is the solar chromosphere, the corona, which eventually becomes the solar wind. Each of these layers is home to a complex array of phenomena, and each layer with it's accompanying attributes is described here.


\subsubsection{Photosphere}\label{sec:121}

As mentioned the photosphere begins where the atmosphere become optically thin. \textquoteleft Visible light' in this instance is usually taken to mean light with a wavelength of 5000\,\AA, hence the emergent light from the photosphere is taken to come from the surface at which $\tau_{5000}=2/3$. This is a consequence of the Eddington-Barbier approximation, and says that emergent flux $F_{\nu}$ from the photosphere is given by

\begin{equation}
F_\nu = \pi B_\nu(\tau=2/3)
\end{equation}
e.g., the emergent flux is given by $\pi$ times blackbody intensity at an optical depth of 2/3, where blackbody intensity $B_\nu$ is given by Planck's law 
\begin{equation}
B_\nu = \frac{2h\pi\nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{\mathrm{exp}(h\nu/k_BT)-1}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $\nu$ is frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is temperature. Integrated over frequency this results in $F = \sigma T^4(\tau=2/3)$, where the frequency integrated flux is proportional to the temperature at $\tau=2/3$, hence the effective temperature of solar blackbody radiation is $T_{eff}=T(\tau=2/3)=5800$\,K. Solar radiation at visible wavelengths is most closely characterised by a blackbody of temperature 5800 K, although the brightness temperature $T_B$ the solar photosphere can deviate from this value, since not all frequencies emerge from the same optical depth.

The visible appearance of the photosphere reveals a small scale granular structure, with granules of typical size scale of 1000\,km with a lifetime of 5-10 minutes. The granules typically show bright centers surrounded by darker intergranular lanes. Doppler measurements reveal that granule centres have a positive (upward) velocity of up to $\sim1$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, with intergranular lanes having a negative (downward) velocity. Such upward and downward flow reveals that granulation at the photosphere are the surface manifestation of convective activity in the deeper layers of the sun, although the size scales of granules are much smaller than the convective plumes believed to permeate the convection zone. As well as the conspicuous granulation at the photospheric surface there is also a much larger scale \textquoteleft super-granulation' which has much the same mechanism as the granules e.g, upflows at granule centre and downflows at the edges in the granular network. The flow speeds are much slower with typical speeds of $0.1$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The have a much larger size of $10,000-30,000$\,km and longer lifetimes of several days. They have an important role in the build up and concentration of magnetic flux in the intergranular lanes. Apart from, granules and supergranules, the most conspicuous features of the photosphere are sunspots. As discussed in the previous section, these are the surface manifestation of concentrated magnetic flux that has penetrated from the solar convective zone into the solar atmosphere. The spots have a temperature of $\sim4000$\,K, which is cooler than the typical solar blackbody temperature of $5800$\,K. The spots have typical magnetic field strengths of on the order of kilo-Gauss, and have an important role to play in solar activity.


Although the the intensity of the Sun in the visible may be approximated closely by a blackbody continuum, there are also the presence of dark absorption or Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum. The most notable of which are the H$\alpha$ and Ca\Rmnum{2} H and K lines.  The presence of these lines reveals that cooler part of the photosphere must overly the hotter base at $\tau_{5000}=1$ \citep{phillips2008}. In fact, the variety of lines that are produced in the solar atmosphere (both emission and absorption) are used to determine the temperature and density stratification of the solar atmosphere.  That has most notably been done in the models of \citep{vernazza1981, fontenla1988, gabriel1976}, whereby a temperature and density profile of the solar atmosphere is used to calculate the emergent intensity, using radiative transfer theory. This temperature and density profile is adjusted until the the modeled emergent intensities match the observed ones. The results of this these models is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:val}. From this Figure we see that there is a temperature minimum at $\sim$500\,km above the photosphere where the temperature drops to $\sim$4400\,K. Beyond this point the temperature begins to rise again, eventually showing a rapid increase at $\sim$2000\,km. The region between the temperature minimum up the height at which temperature begins to rise rapidly is known as the chromosphere\footnote{These boundaries can vary, depending on the phenomenon observed e.g., spicules are chromospheric phenomenon which can extend far beyond the upper boundary of $\sim$2000\,km}. 

%About 15% of photospheric opacity is attributed to absorption features. The rest is H- opacity

\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Chromosphere}\label{sec:122}

As predicted by the models of \citep{vernazza1981, fontenla1988, gabriel1976}, at $\sim$500\,km above the $\tau_{5000}=1$ surface the temperature drops to a minimum of $\sim$4400\,K. Beyond this minimum the temperature begins to rise again, demarcating the beginning of the chromosphere. This layer of the atmosphere is generally accepted to extend to a height at which temperatures reach 20,000\,K, however temperatures as high as $\sim$$1\times10^5$\,K are sometimes attributed to chromospheric heights, hence it is observable at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths as well as visible. 

The chromosphere is primarily observed through the the Fraunhofer H$\alpha$ and Ca\Rmnum{2} H and K lines. These lines in particular provide a good diagnostic of the chromospheric environment over a large height range since different sections of the lines are formed over various heights. By viewing the sun at or near the cores of the lines we may view different height s in the chromospheric part of the atmosphere. The chromosphere, when observed using the Ca lines, shows a highly non-uniform structured and structured appearance. The structure is made up of dark cells with a diameter of approximately 30,000\,km, with bright boundaries of the cells making up a network of bright features known as \textquoteleft the chromospheric network'. These network boundaries consisting of bright points are positions of near vertical magnetic field with a strength of 10\,Gauss. This chromospheric network is directly related to the supergranular structure as observed in the chromosphere i.e., the supergranular flows in the photosphere tend to transport field toward the boundaries of the network where they may coalesce and strengthen. These regions of strong magnetic field facilitate heating in the upper chromosphere and hence show up as regions of enhanced emission (by magnetic acoustic oscillations) in the centers of the Ca\Rmnum{2} K3, for example \citep{mcateer2002}. Enhanced emission in the internetwork regions (supergranule centres) show up as bright points when viewing Ca H2V and are now accepted to be formed by heat of the mid-low chromosphere by acoustic shocks \citep{carlsson1997}

Beyond the temperature minimum there is a broad temperature plateau between $\sim$$1000-2000$\,km, after which the temperature starts to increase dramatically. When the temperature reaches 20,000\,K the extremely prominent Ly-$\alpha$ emission line is formed, with a wavelength of 191.5\,nm, and this is accompanied by other prominent ultraviolet lines such as those of C \Rmnum{4}, formed at temperatures of $\sim$110,000\,K. Such high temperatures are generally considered to be outside the range of the chromosphere and are indicative of a thin layer of the atmosphere known as the transition region. This layer is on the order of a few hundred kilometers thick but has an extremely steep temperature gradient, carrying temperatures into the mega-Kelvin range. The region of the atmosphere with temperatures greater than $1\times10^{6}$\,K is known as the solar corona.

%Acoustic shocks heat the low-mid chromosphere in the internetwork region (supergranule centres) and show up as bright points when viewing Ca H2V lines. But the magnetic bright points (at the network boudnary) in higher altitude lines are thought to be upper chromosphere where MHD waves heat the environment, as evidenced by brightening in Ca K3 core. 

%It seems as though whether it's acoustic or magnetic heating depends on the lines (or position in the line) that we look at. If we see bright points in low altitude lines then is shocks. Bright points in high altitude lines correspond magnetic heating.

%Details in the chromosphere are imaged using the lines of H-alpha and Ca II H and K. These Fraunhofer lines are formed over a large range in heights.

%The H-alpha line is photoelectrically controlled, so the decrease in line intensity is to do with the source function being lower because of a lack of photospheric photons at that height the line centre 'samples

%Ca II  H and K is collisionally controlled so the decrease in line intensity is to do with the source function being lower because of the dropping temperature

%Different regions in the Ca II  H and K lines sample different heights in the photosphere/chromosphere. Tuning imagers to different parts of these lines allows imaging of chromosphere at different heights.

%Chromospheric lines not in the visible are the Mg h and k Fraunhofer lines, also collisionally controlled. There is also the Ly-alpha emission line, formed at 20,000 K, which is optically thin. There is C IV, formed at 110,000 K, at this point we are starting to sample to transition region.


%Note: Fraunhofer lines such as Calcium H and K are not as simple as a case of a cloud of cooler gas absorbing lines from a hot radiations source. The Fraunhofer lines are a consequence of the Eddington-Barbier Approximation i.e., that the emergent intensity is equal to the source function at an optical depth of 2/3. So in the centre of the line the opacity goes up and optical depth 2/3 is higher in the atmosphere where the plasma is cooler. Hence, the line is darker at the centre (due to the smaller source function at the cooler temperature).

\subsubsection{Corona}\label{sec:123}

The outermost layer of the solar atmosphere is known as the solar corona, beginning at $\sim$2500\,km above the photosphere. It has an electron number density of $10^{9}$\,cm$^{-3}$ at its base in quiet regions, decreasing to $10^{6}$\,cm$^{-3}$ at distance of $1\,R_{\odot}$ from the solar surface. The models of \citep{vernazza1981, fontenla1988, gabriel1976} reveal that beyond the transition region ($\sim$2500\,km) the temperature in the corona reaches well over $1\times10^{6}$\,K. Such high temperatures allow the formation of emission features that belong to highly ionized heavy elements, for example Fe \Rmnum{9}, up to as high as Fe \Rmnum{24}. The presence of these highly ionized species (and many others) show that the corona has temperatures in the $1-2$\,MK range in quiet regions, active regions may exhibit temperatures in the range of $2-6$\,MK, while coronal holes may be lower than 1\,MK. The temperatures of a flaring active region can be even higher than this, reaching tens of mega-Kelvin. The high temperatures and presence of highly ionized species of heavy elements means the corona is an emitter in the ultraviolet and X-ray. When viewed at these wavelengths, the corona appears highly structured, showing concentrations of bright loops known as active regions (Fig.~\ref{fig:aia171}).

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Ultraviolet wavelengths allow observations of the very low corona, perhaps to only a few scale heights. However, the most extensive observations of the corona are in the visible, generally known as the 'white-light' corona. The corona's white-light radiation is primarily due to scattering of photospheric light by particles and dust grains. The component which is due to Thomson scattering by free electrons is known as the {\it Kontinuierlich} or K-corona. The spectrum of this light is same as the photospheric continuum except for the absence of Fraunhofer lines. These lines are 'washed-out' of the spectrum due to thermal Doppler broadening of the high-velocity free electrons on the corona. The emission is optically thin, so the intensity is due to the number of scattering agents along the line of site. The emission is also highly polarized, depending on he line of site of the observer (we will return to this important aspect later). The K-corona dominates white-light emission from low atmosphere to $\sim$4$R_{\odot}$. After this height, there is an increasing contribution from Rayleigh or Mie scattering from interplanetary dust grains, known as the the Fraunhoferor F-corona. Since these dust grains move at a much slower velocity than the electrons, they do not wash out the Fraunhofer lines of the photospheric spectrum. The F-corona extend far beyond Earth and a can be viewed in the night sky as {\it Zodiacal light}.

Ultraviolet and white-light observations remain the primary method of imaging the low and extended corona, respectively. However, the corona is also a strong emitter across the entire radio wavelength range, from microwave to kilometric wavelengths. Indeed, metric wavelengths provide a method of imaging the quiet and thermal corona in an optically thick regime beyond $1\,R_{\odot}$, an ability that does not exist in white-light and UV observations. These radio observations can reveal much of the same features as other wavelengths (albeit at lower spatial resolution) such as bright emission of active regions and also coronal holes (Fig.~\ref{fig:lowfeq}).
\begin{figure}[t!]

\label{fig:lowfreq}
\end{figure}

The quiet corona at metric wavelengths is primarily an emitter of thermal Bremsstrahlung i.e., thermal electrons accelerating in the Coloumb electric fields of protons. The height at which metric radiation escapes from the corona depends on the Bremsstrahlung absorption process, known as free-free opacity and given by
\begin{equation}
\kappa_{ff} \sim \frac{n^2}{\nu^2T^{3/2}} 
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the electron number density, $\nu$ is the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, and $T$ is the temperature. Qualitatively, for a given frequency the density must drop below a certain value for the radiation to become optically thin and escape the solar atmosphere. In the radio band, even the highest frequency (microwaves) do not escape until densities drop to chromospheric values. Hence a microwave image of the sun will provide a direct observation of light escaping from the chromosphere. Reducing the frequency further still to the $10^{8}$Hz (metric wavelengths), the density must drop to coronal values before the free-free opacity is low enough for radiation to be optically thin. Hence, metric wavelength radiation escapes the solar atmosphere only in the outer corona. For example 150\,MHz imaging of the solar atmosphere may image an optically thick atmosphere out to a height of $\sim 0.5\,R_{\odot}$. The existence of an optically thick atmosphere at these wavelengths allows a direct probing of coronal temperatures at these heights. Using the solution to the radiative transfer equation
\begin{equation}
T_B = T_0e^{-\tau_{\nu}} + T_e(1-e^{-\tau_{\nu}})
\label{eq:rad_trans}
\end{equation}
where $T_B$ is the observed brightness temperature, $T_0$ is the background source brightness temperature, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature of a cloud of plasma between observer and source\footnote{Note that radio observations often use brightness and electron temperatures in place of specific intensity and the source function because radio observations are often calibrated via a load of known temperature}, we can separate the this equation into two regimes. Firstly,
in the optically thick regime $\tau_{\nu}>>1$ equation~\ref{eq:rad_trans} reduces to $T_B = T_e$, indicating that the brightness temperature is a direct measure of the electron temperature in solar atmospheric plasma. Secondly, in the optically thin regime $\tau_{\nu}<<1$, equation~\ref{eq:rad_trans} reduces to 
\begin{equation}
T_B = T_0(1-\tau_{\tau}) + T_e\tau_{\nu}
\end{equation}
Considering the case of no background source we see that for the optically thin regime $T_B = T_e\tau_{\nu}$ i.e., the brightness temperature is not a direct measure of the electron temperature, but is reduced by a factor of $\tau_{\nu}$. Note if the electrons are thermodynamic equilibrium then $T_e$ is simply the temperature of the plasma $T$, given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, meaning  a measure of brightness temperature allows a direct probing of the coronas thermal properties at this height. For example, a measure of brightness temperature at 100\,MHz will given $T_b\sim10^6$\,K. However, beyond 1\,GHz the corona becomes optically thin and brightness temperature then drops to $\sim10^{5}$\,K. 

It is also possible to observe non-thermal source in the solar atmosphere, especially during times of high activity. In the case of non-thermal radiation, $T_e$ is replaced by $T_{eff}$, the effective temperature, which is related to the average energy of the emitting particles $<E>=kT_{eff}$, where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant. In such a case, the brightness temperatures may be in excess of $10^{9}$\,K. These emissions are usually associated with flaring and eruptive activity and include gyrosynchrotron emission and plasma emission resulting. Since the observation of plasma emission is partly the subject of this thesis, it will be returned to in detail in chapter 2.

\section{Coronal Mass Ejections and Coronal Shocks}\label{sec:2}

The solar corona is home to a variety of dynamic and highly energetic activity, the cause of which is the build-up and release of magnetic energy. This energy release results in the acceleration of charged particles, emission of electromagnetic radiation across the entire spectrum, the heating of plasma, the ejection of large scale eruptions and the driving of plasma shocks through the corona and heliosphere. Large scale eruptions of plasma and the driving of shocks are the subject of this thesis, the following provides an observational overview and open questions concerning these phenomena.


\subsection{Coronal Mass Ejections}\label{sec:20}

The largest flare ever to have been recorded occurred on September 1st 1859, observed by the astronomer Richard Carrington \citep{carrington1859}. Approximately 17 hours after Carrington recorded the event, a powerful geomagnetic storm began at Earth, producing brilliant aurora and damaging telegraph systems on both sides of the Atlantic ocean. The event aroused much speculation on a causal link between the phenomena Carrrington observed on the Sun and the magnetic activity recorded throughout the Earth \citep{balfour1861}. It was not until 1919 that a theory was put forward to suggest plasma transients emitted from the Sun may impact the Earth and cause geomagnetic activity and the aurora \citet{lindemann1919}, a process later elaborated upon by \citet{chapman1930}. Up until 1940s, the only evidence confirming the the plasma transient hypothesis was the correlation between solar and geomagnetic activity. However, following the development of radio receiver technology during World War Two, much interest was given to solar radio bursts and their indication that disturbances travel away from the Sun at speeds of up to 500\,km\,s$^{-1}$\citep{wild1958}. Further evidence came from the fields of cosmic rays studies, when it was suggested the ground level detections of particles at Earth such as those reported by \citep{forbush1946} may be related to a acceleration of particles by a shock moving through the solar atmosphere \citep{wild1963}. Eventually this activity was summarised by \citet{gold1962}, who hypothesised the expulsion of magnetized plasma from the solar atmosphere and the driving of a shock by this expulsion tha accelerates particles into interplanetary space. 

Gold's paper marked over 100 years of indirect evidence for the expulsion of plasma transients from the surface of the Sun toward Earth. However, it was not until December 14th, 1971 (112 years after the Carrington event) that the first direct images of one of these plasma expulsions was made with the coronagraph on board the 7th Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-7) satellite \citep{tousey1971}. This marked the beginning of white-light CME studies as we know them today, and it was followed by a number of other instruments, including Skylab \citep{macqueen1980}, P78-1 \citep{sheeley1980}, and the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) \citep{hundhausen1999}, which provided corongraph observations up until 1989. The modern era of CME observations began 1995 with the launch of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory \citep[\emph{SOHO};][]{dom95} and it more sophisticated suite of instruments, including the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraphs (LASCO). In 2006 LASCO was joined by the COR coronagraphs onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory \citep[\emph{STEREO};][]{kai08} and together they provide observations of of CMEs from the low solar atmosphere into interplanetary distances. The past 40 years of coronagraph operations in space have yielded observations of tens of thousands of CMEs, allowing a direct determination of their physical properties and a confirmation of what was first postulated by Carrington and others over 150 years ago.

A modern understanding of corona mass ejections (CMEs) tells us that they are large-scale eruptions of plasma and magnetic field that propagate from the low solar corona into interplanetary space. They have speeds in the range $10-2500$\,km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$ \citep{gopal2004}, masses of $10^{13}-10^{16}$\,g, and kinetic energies of $10^{22} - 10^{25}$\,J \citep{vour2010}, making them the most energetic explosive events in the solar system and a major cause of adverse space weather in the near-Earth environment. 

Figure~\ref{fig:lasco_c3} shows the typical appearance of a CME in white light coronagraph images, having a three-part structure of bright front, followed by a darker cavity, and a bright core. Although this CME is regarded as \textquoteleft typical' in appearance, many CMEs do not have all of these features and some appear to have more complex morphological structures \citep{pick2006}, with only around 30\% of all CMEs exhibiting the three part structure \citep{webbHu1987}. The varied nature of their appearance and morphology can usually be attributed to projection effects i.e., the CME is a 3-D object projected onto a 2-D image, hence its appearance depends on its orientation in the corona.
